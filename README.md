*Tool for Sculpting Spatialized Audio [(demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weDa5UuzI1E)*

A system built in OpenFrameworks and Max that simultaneously records the sounds and gestures of a user using a Kinect. An individual can start a recording at any point in space, then traverse a path with a specific body part. This path is recorded in step with the audio, which allows one to trace back the precise location at which a sound was recorded. As soon as the user ends a recording, it begins to loop over both time and space, following the path the recording took. Audio is rendered at the position of another body part, which allows the user to “play” the space.
